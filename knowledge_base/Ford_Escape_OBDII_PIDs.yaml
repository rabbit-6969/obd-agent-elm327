# Diagnostic Notes
diagnostic_notes:
  general: |
    Ford Escape uses manufacturer-specific PIDs beyond standard OBD-II.
    Access requires compatible scan tool with Ford enhanced protocols.
    Parameter availability varies significantly by model year and engine.
    
  protocol_info: |
    2008-2012: ISO 15765-4 CAN (11-bit, 500 kbaud for powertrain)
    2013+: ISO 15765-4 CAN (11-bit, 500 kbaud for powertrain)
    Some parameters require extended diagnostic session (Mode 0x10)
    
  tool_requirements: |
    Basic OBD-II scanner: Standard PIDs only (RPM, coolant temp, etc.)

# Multi-Module Parameter Access
multi_module_notes: |
  Some parameters are available from multiple ECUs:
  
  Odometer:
    - ESCAPE_ODO_726 (Instrument Cluster) - displayed value
    - ESCAPE_PCM_VEH_ODO (PCM) - stored value
    Use both to detect odometer tampering
  
  Fuel Level:
    - ESCAPE_FLI (PCM) - calculated value
    - ESCAPE_FLI_ALT (IPC) - displayed value
    May differ slightly due to filtering
  
  Vehicle Speed:
    - ESCAPE_VSS (PCM) - calculated from transmission
    - ESCAPE_FR_VSS, ESCAPE_FL_VSS, etc. (ABS) - individual wheel speeds
    Use wheel speeds to detect drivetrain slippage
  
  Distance to Empty:
    - ESCAPE_DTE (calculated) - raw calculation
    - ESCAPE_DTE_DISP (displayed) - filtered for driver display
    Displayed value is smoothed to avoid rapid changes

# Advanced Diagnostic Scenarios Using Extended Parameters

advanced_diagnostics:
  abs_wheel_speed_comparison:
    description: "Compare all four wheel speeds to detect issues"
    parameters:
      - "ESCAPE_FR_VSS"
      - "ESCAPE_FL_VSS"
      - "ESCAPE_RR_VSS"
      - "ESCAPE_RL_VSS"
    interpretation: |
      All four should be equal when driving straight.
      Differences indicate:
      - Tire size mismatch
      - Wheel speed sensor failure
      - Differential problems
      - Tire pressure differences
      
  transmission_temperature_monitoring:
    description: "Monitor transmission health via temperature"
    parameters:
      - "ESCAPE_TOT"
      - "ESCAPE_ECT"
    interpretation: |
      Normal: Trans temp 10-20°C above coolant temp
      Warning: Trans temp >110°C
      Critical: Trans temp >120°C
      If trans temp much higher than coolant, check:
      - Transmission cooler
      - Fluid level
      - Torque converter lockup
      
  tpms_comprehensive_check:
    description: "Full tire pressure monitoring"
    parameters:
      - "ESCAPE_TP_FL"
      - "ESCAPE_TP_FR"
      - "ESCAPE_TP_RLO"
      - "ESCAPE_TP_RRO"
      - "ESCAPE_TPMS_WARN"
    interpretation: |
      All tires should be within 2 psi of each other
      Typical: 32-35 psi cold
      Low pressure: <28 psi triggers warning
      Check for:
      - Slow leaks (gradual pressure drop)
      - Temperature effects (pressure varies with temp)
      - Sensor battery life (7-10 years typical)
      
  battery_health_assessment:
    description: "Monitor battery condition"
    parameters:
      - "ESCAPE_BATT_SOC"
      - "ESCAPE_BATT_TEMP"
      - "ESCAPE_BATT_AGE"
    interpretation: |
      Healthy battery: SOC >80%, temp 10-40°C
      Weak battery: SOC <70%, slow charging
      Failed battery: SOC <50%, won't hold charge
      Cold weather: Capacity reduced below 0°C
      Hot weather: Accelerated aging above 40°C
      
  ac_system_diagnosis:
    description: "Air conditioning system health"
    parameters:
      - "ESCAPE_AC_P"
      - "ESCAPE_AC_STATE"
      - "ESCAPE_AAT_ALT"
    interpretation: |
      Normal pressure: 25-45 psi (low side), 150-250 psi (high side)
      Low pressure: System undercharged, leak present
      High pressure: System overcharged, restriction, or cooling issue
      Compressor cycling: Normal in hot weather
      No pressure change when AC on: Compressor not engaging
      
  stability_control_monitoring:
    description: "Monitor vehicle dynamics"
    parameters:
      - "ESCAPE_LAT_G"
      - "ESCAPE_LAT_ANGLE"
      - "ESCAPE_STEER_ANGLE"
      - "ESCAPE_FR_VSS"
      - "ESCAPE_FL_VSS"
      - "ESCAPE_RR_VSS"
      - "ESCAPE_RL_VSS"
    interpretation: |
      Lateral G: Cornering force (0.3-0.8g normal driving)
      Lateral angle: Vehicle yaw (should match steering input)
      Mismatched values indicate:
      - Stability control intervention
      - Tire slip
      - Suspension issues
      - Alignment problems

# ECU Response Address Mapping
ecu_response_addresses:
  description: "CAN response addresses for each ECU (request address + 8)"
  mappings:
    0x720: 0x728  # IPC request → IPC response
    0x726: 0x72E  # BCM request → BCM response
    0x760: 0x768  # ABS request → ABS response
    0x764: 0x76C  # Cruise Control request → response
    0x7DF: 0x7E8  # Broadcast → PCM responds
    0x7E0: 0x7E8  # PCM request → PCM response

# Broadcast Address Explanation
broadcast_address_notes: |
  0x7DF is the OBD-II functional/broadcast address defined in ISO 15765-4.
  
  How it works:
  - Send request to 0x7DF (all ECUs listen)
  - The ECU that handles that parameter responds
  - Response comes from specific ECU address + 8
  
  Example:
    Request:  0x7DF → [broadcast]
    Response: 0x7E8 ← [PCM responds]
  
  Usage:
  - Use 0x7DF for standard OBD-II Mode 01, 03, 07, 09 requests
  - Use specific addresses (0x7E0, 0x726, etc.) for UDS commands
  - Always expect response from (request_address + 8)
  
  ESCAPE_TOT (Transmission Oil Temperature):
  - Listed under 0x7DF in OBDB
  - Actually handled by PCM
  - Response comes from 0x7E8 (PCM response address)
