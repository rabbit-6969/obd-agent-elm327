  fuel: "Gasoline"
  notes: "Uses CAN 2.0b protocol, HS-CAN for diagnostics. ABS module requires UDS Service 0x19 for DTC reading (standard OBD-II Mode 03 not supported)."

modules:
  ABS:
    full_name: "Anti-Lock Braking System Module"
    location: "Engine bay, driver side near brake master cylinder"
    address: "7B0"
    response_address: "7B8"
    protocol: "ISO 15765-4 CAN (11 bit ID, 500 kbaud)"
    accessibility: "PARTIAL"  # UDS accessible, not standard OBD-II
    diagnostic_protocol: "UDS Service 0x19"
    part_numbers:
      - "89540-35XXX"  # Varies by trim/options
    common_issues:
      - "Wheel speed sensor failure"
      - "ABS pump motor failure"
      - "Yaw rate sensor issues"
      - "Steering angle sensor calibration"
    diagnostic_notes: |
      ABS module does NOT respond to standard OBD-II Mode 03 (ReadDTC).
      Must use UDS Service 0x19 (ReadDTCInformation) instead.
      
      Typical Toyota/Lexus ABS addressing:
      - Request: 0x7B0
      - Response: 0x7B8
      
      ⚠ CRITICAL BEHAVIOR (2007-2010 Toyota/Lexus ABS Modules):
      These modules DO NOT RESPOND to UDS Service 0x19 when there are no DTCs stored.
      This is INTENTIONAL Toyota design, not a communication failure.
      
      If you get "no response" to Service 0x19:
      - Check if ABS warning light is OFF → No DTCs present (NORMAL)
      - Check if ABS warning light is ON → Try workarounds below
      
      Workarounds for "no response" issue:
      1. Enter Extended Diagnostic Session first (Service 0x10 0x03)
      2. Use Service 0x19 Sub-function 0x01 (Read DTC Count) - more reliable
      3. Treat 300-500ms timeout as "No DTCs present" (not error)
      
      Affected vehicles (same ABS module behavior):
      - Toyota FJ Cruiser (2007-2014)
      - Toyota 4Runner (2003-2009)
      - Toyota Tacoma (2005-2015)
      - Toyota Tundra (2007-2013)
      - Toyota Sequoia (2008-2012)
      - Lexus GX470 (2003-2009)
      
      UDS Service 0x19 sub-functions:
      - 0x01: reportNumberOfDTCByStatusMask (read DTC count) ✓ MORE RELIABLE
      - 0x02: reportDTCByStatusMask (read DTCs with status filter) ✓ SUPPORTED (no response when no DTCs)
      - 0x0A: reportSupportedDTC (list all supported DTCs) ✗ NOT SUPPORTED
      - 0x04: reportDTCSnapshotIdentification (freeze frame data) ? UNTESTED
      
      Note: Sub-function 0x0A is optional per ISO 14229-1 and not implemented
      by FJ Cruiser ABS module. Use sub-function 0x02 with mask 0xFF instead.
      
      DTC Status Mask (8 bits):
      - 0xFF: All DTCs
      - 0x08: Confirmed DTCs only
      - 0x04: Pending DTCs only
      
      DTC Format: 3 bytes per DTC + 1 status byte
      Example: C1 55 1A 08 = DTC C1551A with status 0x08 (confirmed)
      
      Clear DTCs: UDS Service 0x14 with mask 0xFFFFFF
      
      Professional diagnosis: Toyota Techstream (proprietary tool) required
      for full ABS diagnostics, actuator tests, and bleeding procedures.

  uds_vs_obdii:
    title: "Why UDS Service 0x19 Instead of OBD-II Mode 03?"
    explanation: |
      Toyota/Lexus ABS modules do not implement standard OBD-II Mode 03 (ReadDTC).
      This is manufacturer-specific behavior - Toyota chose to use UDS Service 0x19 instead.
      
      Differences:
      - OBD-II Mode 03: Simple request (03), simple response (43 XX XX)
      - UDS Service 0x19: More complex, requires sub-function and status mask
      
      Advantages of UDS Service 0x19:
      - More detailed DTC status information (8-bit status byte)
      - Can filter DTCs by status (confirmed, pending, etc.)
      - Can retrieve freeze frame data
      - Can list all supported DTCs
      
      This is why generic OBD-II scanners often cannot read ABS DTCs on Toyota vehicles.
      Professional scan tools and manufacturer-specific tools support UDS Service 0x19.
  
  dtc_status_byte:
    title: "Understanding DTC Status Byte"
    explanation: |
      Each DTC in UDS Service 0x19 response includes a status byte (8 bits):
      
      Bit 0 (testFailed): Test failed at time of request
      Bit 1 (testFailedThisOperationCycle): Failed this ignition cycle
      Bit 2 (pendingDTC): DTC is pending (not yet confirmed)
      Bit 3 (confirmedDTC): DTC is confirmed (stored)
      Bit 4 (testNotCompletedSinceLastClear): Test not run since clear
      Bit 5 (testFailedSinceLastClear): Failed at least once since clear
      Bit 6 (testNotCompletedThisOperationCycle): Test not run this cycle
      Bit 7 (warningIndicatorRequested): Warning light should be on
      
      Common status values:
      - 0x08: Confirmed DTC (bit 3 set)
      - 0x04: Pending DTC (bit 2 set)
      - 0x0C: Confirmed + Pending (bits 2 and 3 set)
      - 0x88: Confirmed + Warning light (bits 3 and 7 set)
